# Errors : 

  # 3 types 
     --> compile time error
     --> run time error
     --> logical error

  # compile time error:
     --> Sythentical errors
     --> eg: writing a statement without proper syntax results compile time error
  
  # run time error:  
     --> inefficiency of system to execute the statement / particular statement
     --> eg: inability of processor to execute the statement result run time error
    --> JVM detects run time error

  # logical error:
     --> depict flaws of the code
     --> eg: write a wrong formula in the code
     --> either detected in compiler or run time

# Exceptions:
     --> problem arises during the execution of program
     --> when it occurs --> normal flow is disrupted --> terminates abnormally

  # major reasons for exceptions:
     --> user entered invalid data
     --> file cannot be found
     --> network connection lost 
     --> JVM out of memory
  

  # 3 catogeries of exceptions:  
     --> checked exceptions
     --> un-checked exceptions
     --> errors

  # checked exceptions:
     --> exceptions that are checked at the compilation time by compiler
     --> called as compile time exceptions

  # un-checked exceptions:   
     --> exceptions that occur at the run time of execution
     --> called as run time exceptions
     --> include programming bugs, such as logic errors or improper use of an API
